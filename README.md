# spring-stand-alone
This is sample spring stand alone project with slf4j logging enabled.
I created this sample project to start learning about spring. I try to keep adding stuff here so that when anybody want
start a new spring project, it will be easy for them to get up and running quickly.

#What this project contains
1. Maven project structure to remove commons-logging and add slf4j as the logging framework.
2. A configuration file for logback so that anybody can change the log level easily.
3. How to create a sample data source in spring and also create transaction manager for the datasource.

Please feel free to use this code(if it suits you!!) and suggest any modifications necessary.
